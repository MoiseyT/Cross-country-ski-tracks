# Interactive map of Russia's cross-country ski trails
__Cross country ski is considered one of the most popular sports in Russia, along with football and running. However, until now, there was no GIS project in Russia that could help find a suitable route for this beautiful winter sport. Link to the GIS project ["Russia's cross-country ski trails"](https://www.skisport.ru/ski-trail-map/)__
## Conceptual model
First of all I decided to look at existing projects. There are great projects in Switzerland, Norway, where you can find the information you need about the cross country ski tracks, see the difficulty of the track, for which style the track exists, and also find out when the last time a ratrak was on the track.
Realizing that not having enough funding would be difficult to do something like this, I decided to reduce the task a bit. That is, I did not add a detailed description of the track, only a link to the club that supports the track. 
So, I decided to write to one of the most popular sites about ski racing in Russia - "Ski Sport". Together with the editorial team, we made a conceptual plan of the GIS project and decided on a table of attributes. It was decided that the complexity of the tracks would be highlighted by color (ðŸ”´ - hard, ðŸŸ¡ - nedium, ðŸ”µ - easy).
